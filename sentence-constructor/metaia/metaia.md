        Cheatsheet:
        | Word | Japanese | Type |
        |------|----------|------|
        | bear | (kuma) | Noun |
        | door | Doa | Noun |
        | garbage | Gomi | Noun |
        | to be (location) | iru | Intransitive Ichidan Verb |
        | to leave | dasu | Transitive Godish Verb |

        Sentence structure:
        [Location] [Subject] [Verb], [Object] [Verb-past]?

        Considerations:
        - This is a compound sentence with two parts connected by a comma.
        - The first part is stating a location where something exists.
        - The second part is asking about a past action.

        Possible next steps:
        - Attempt an answer.
        - Ask clues about location marking.
        - Ask clues about how to connect two sentences.
        - Ask clues about question formation.
        - Ask clues about verb conjugation.
